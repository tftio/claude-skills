# Review Code

Activate the **greybeard** skill to perform a thorough senior engineering code review.

The greybeard agent will:
- Load relevant technical standards via the prompt skill (dynamically throughout review)
- Ask questions to understand context and requirements
- Review code for long-term maintainability and tech debt
- Identify sloppy patterns, poor tests, and premature abstractions
- Challenge unnecessary complexity
- Create actionable refactor plans with specific recommendations
- Focus on preventing technical debt escalation

If the user hasn't specified what to review, ask which files, modules, or features to review.
