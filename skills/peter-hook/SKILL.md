# Peter Hook Runtime Operations

This skill provides access to peter-hook runtime operations for running and linting code using configured git hooks.

## When to Use This Skill

- Running hooks manually against changed files (pre-commit, pre-push, etc.)
- Linting code by running hooks against all matching files
- Validating hook configurations
- Discovering what hooks are available
- Checking peter-hook health and configuration
- Troubleshooting hook execution issues
- Testing hook behavior with dry-run mode

## CLI Tool Location

The peter-hook binary should be available at: `$HOME/.local/bin/peter-hook` or in system PATH.

Verify with:
```bash
which peter-hook
peter-hook version
```

## What is Peter Hook?

Peter Hook is a hierarchical git hooks manager for monorepos that:
- Runs configured hooks from `hooks.toml` files
- Supports per-file hierarchical resolution (different paths can have different hooks)
- Enables intelligent file targeting (only run hooks for changed files)
- Provides lint mode for running hooks on all files in a directory
- Supports parallel execution where safe

## Core Runtime Commands

### Run Hooks (Git Event Mode)

Run hooks for a specific git event (pre-commit, pre-push, etc.) on changed files:

```bash
# Run hooks for pre-commit event (staged + working directory changes)
peter-hook run pre-commit

# Run on all files instead of only changed files
peter-hook run pre-commit --all-files

# Test what would run without executing (dry-run)
peter-hook run pre-commit --dry-run

# Run with debug output
peter-hook run pre-commit --debug

# Run hooks for other git events
peter-hook run pre-push
peter-hook run commit-msg .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG
peter-hook run post-commit
```

**How it works:**
1. Detects changed files from git
2. For each changed file, finds nearest `hooks.toml`
3. Runs hooks defined for that event from the relevant config
4. Only runs hooks whose file patterns match the changed files (unless `run_always = true`)

**When to use:**
- Before committing to catch issues early
- Before pushing to validate changes
- Testing hook behavior manually
- Debugging why hooks failed during git operations

**Output:**
- Shows each hook's execution status
- Displays stdout/stderr from failing hooks
- Reports overall pass/fail status

### Lint Mode (All Files)

Run hooks on **all matching files** in current directory and subdirectories:

```bash
# Run a hook in lint mode on all matching files
peter-hook lint <hook-name>

# Run with dry-run to see what would execute
peter-hook lint <hook-name> --dry-run

# Run with debug output
peter-hook lint <hook-name> --debug

# Examples
peter-hook lint ruff-check      # Run ruff on all .py files
peter-hook lint clippy           # Run clippy on all .rs files
peter-hook lint eslint           # Run eslint on all .js files
peter-hook lint format-check     # Check formatting on all files
```

**How lint mode differs from run:**
- Treats current directory as repository root (not git root)
- Discovers **all** non-ignored files matching patterns (not just changed)
- No git operations performed
- Respects `.gitignore` rules hierarchically

**Execution by hook type:**
- `per-file` (default): All files passed as arguments ‚Üí `tool file1 file2 file3`
- `in-place`: Hook runs once in config directory ‚Üí `pytest` (autodiscovery)
- `other`: Hook receives files via template variables (`{CHANGED_FILES}`, etc.)

**When to use:**
- Running formatters/linters on entire codebase
- Pre-CI validation of all files in a directory
- Cleaning up code quality across a project
- One-off checks without git operations
- Testing hooks against full file sets

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# Validate all Python files in current project
cd backend/
peter-hook lint ruff-check

# Format all Rust files
cd src/
peter-hook lint rust-format

# Run all hooks in a group
peter-hook lint pre-commit
```

### Validate Configuration

Validate hook configuration and check for errors:

```bash
# Basic validation
peter-hook validate

# Validate with import diagnostics
peter-hook validate --trace-imports

# Get JSON output (for programmatic use)
peter-hook validate --trace-imports --json

# Validate with debug output
peter-hook validate --debug
```

**What it checks:**
- TOML syntax validity
- Hook definition completeness (required fields)
- Group references (all included hooks exist)
- Dependency cycles
- Conflicting options (e.g., `files` + `run_always`)
- Import paths and overrides
- Template variable usage

**JSON output format:**
```json
{
  "imports": [
    {
      "file": "../hooks.lib.toml",
      "status": "success",
      "hooks_imported": ["rust-format", "rust-lint"]
    }
  ],
  "overrides": [
    {
      "name": "rust-lint",
      "original_source": "../hooks.lib.toml",
      "override_source": "./hooks.toml"
    }
  ],
  "cycles": [],
  "unused": []
}
```

**When to use:**
- After editing hooks.toml
- Before committing configuration changes
- Troubleshooting hook issues
- Understanding import merge order
- In CI/CD pipelines as quality gate

### Check Health

Run health check to validate peter-hook setup:

```bash
# Check health
peter-hook doctor

# With debug output
peter-hook doctor --debug
```

**Example output:**
```
üè• peter-hook health check
==========================

Git Repository:
  ‚úÖ Git repository found
  ‚úÖ Git hooks installed

Configuration:
  ‚úÖ hooks.toml found
  ‚úÖ Configuration valid

Updates:
  ‚úÖ Running latest version (v3.2.1)

‚úÖ Everything looks healthy!
```

**What it checks:**
- Git repository detection
- hooks.toml file presence
- Configuration validity
- Git hooks installation status
- Version status

**When to use:**
- Troubleshooting hook issues
- Verifying setup after installation
- Diagnosing configuration problems
- Checking if hooks.toml exists

### List Available Hooks

List all hooks and groups defined in configuration:

```bash
# List hooks
peter-hook list

# With debug output
peter-hook list --debug
```

**Example output:**
```
Git hooks installed in this repository:
  - pre-commit
  - pre-push
  - commit-msg
```

**When to use:**
- Discovering what hooks are configured
- Checking what git events have hooks
- Verifying hook installation
- Understanding available lint targets

## Understanding hooks.toml Configuration

Peter Hook uses `hooks.toml` files to define hooks. Here's what you need to know for runtime operations:

### Hook Definition Structure

```toml
[hooks.hook-name]
command = "cargo clippy"                    # Command to run
description = "Run clippy linter"           # Description
modifies_repository = false                 # Safety flag (false = read-only, true = modifies files)
files = ["**/*.rs", "Cargo.toml"]          # File patterns (optional)
execution_type = "per-file"                 # How files are passed (per-file | in-place | other)
depends_on = ["format"]                     # Dependencies (optional)
run_always = false                          # Ignore file targeting (optional)
```

### Hook Groups

```toml
[groups.pre-commit]
includes = ["format", "lint", "test"]       # Hooks to run
execution = "parallel"                      # parallel | sequential | force-parallel
description = "Pre-commit validation"
```

### Execution Types

**`per-file` (default):**
- Files passed as command arguments
- Example: `eslint file1.js file2.js file3.js`
- Use for: linters, formatters, type checkers

**`in-place`:**
- Hook runs once in config directory
- Tool discovers files itself
- Example: `pytest` (finds test files), `jest`, `cargo test`
- Use for: test runners, tools with auto-discovery

**`other`:**
- Manual file handling via template variables
- Example: `custom-tool {CHANGED_FILES}`
- Use for: custom tools, scripts that need special file handling

### File Targeting

```toml
# Hook only runs if matching files changed
files = ["**/*.rs"]

# Hook always runs regardless of changes
run_always = true

# No files = always runs
# (no files field)
```

**Glob patterns:**
- `**/*.rs` - All .rs files recursively
- `*.toml` - TOML files in config directory
- `src/**/*.py` - Python files in src/
- `**/*.{js,ts}` - JavaScript or TypeScript files

### Template Variables

Available in commands, workdir, and env:

```toml
{HOOK_DIR}              # Directory containing hooks.toml
{REPO_ROOT}             # Git repository root
{WORKING_DIR}           # Current working directory
{PROJECT_NAME}          # Name of directory containing hooks.toml
{HOME_DIR}              # User's home directory
{CHANGED_FILES}         # Space-delimited changed files
{CHANGED_FILES_LIST}    # Newline-delimited changed files
{CHANGED_FILES_FILE}    # Path to temp file with changed files
```

## Common Workflows

### Running Hooks Before Commit

```bash
# Check what hooks would run
peter-hook list

# Run pre-commit hooks manually
peter-hook run pre-commit

# If issues found, fix and re-run
# ... make fixes ...
peter-hook run pre-commit

# Dry-run to see what would execute
peter-hook run pre-commit --dry-run
```

### Linting Entire Codebase

```bash
# Validate configuration first
peter-hook validate

# List available hooks
peter-hook list

# Run specific linter on all files
peter-hook lint rust-lint

# Run formatter on all files
peter-hook lint rust-format

# Run entire pre-commit suite on all files
peter-hook lint pre-commit
```

### Validating Hook Configuration Changes

```bash
# After editing hooks.toml
peter-hook validate

# Check import merge order and overrides
peter-hook validate --trace-imports

# Get structured diagnostics
peter-hook validate --trace-imports --json | jq .

# Test hooks without executing
peter-hook run pre-commit --dry-run
peter-hook lint clippy --dry-run
```

### Troubleshooting Hook Failures

```bash
# Check health
peter-hook doctor

# Validate configuration
peter-hook validate

# Run with debug output
peter-hook run pre-commit --debug

# Test individual hook in lint mode
peter-hook lint failing-hook

# Dry-run to see execution plan
peter-hook run pre-commit --dry-run
```

### Understanding File Targeting

```bash
# See what hooks would run for staged changes
peter-hook run pre-commit --dry-run

# Force all hooks to run regardless of files
peter-hook run pre-commit --all-files

# Run on all files for specific hook
peter-hook lint hook-name
```

## Hierarchical Hook Resolution

Peter Hook supports **per-file hierarchical resolution** - each changed file independently finds its nearest `hooks.toml`:

```
/monorepo/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks.toml                  # Defines: pre-push
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks.toml              # Defines: pre-commit
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ api/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ server.rs           # Modified file
```

**When running `pre-commit`:**
1. `server.rs` walks up to find nearest `hooks.toml` with pre-commit hooks
2. Finds `/monorepo/backend/hooks.toml`
3. Runs hooks from that config in `/monorepo/backend/` directory
4. Only runs hooks whose file patterns match the changed files

**When running `pre-push`:**
1. `server.rs` walks up to find nearest `hooks.toml` with pre-push hooks
2. Doesn't find it in `/monorepo/backend/hooks.toml`
3. Falls back to `/monorepo/hooks.toml`
4. Runs hooks from root config

**Benefits:**
- Different paths can have different quality standards
- Only relevant hooks run based on changed files
- Monorepo subprojects can have their own validation
- Gradual migration possible (add strict rules to new code only)

## Output and Exit Codes

**Exit codes:**
- `0` - All hooks passed
- `1` - One or more hooks failed
- `1` - Configuration validation failed

**Output format:**
- Shows which hooks are running
- Displays execution progress
- Reports stdout/stderr from failing hooks
- Summarizes final status

**Debug mode:**
```bash
peter-hook run pre-commit --debug
```
- Shows verbose execution details
- Displays file matching logic
- Shows template variable expansion
- Useful for troubleshooting

## Dry-Run Mode

Test what would run without executing:

```bash
# See what would run for pre-commit
peter-hook run pre-commit --dry-run

# See what files would be checked
peter-hook lint clippy --dry-run

# Output shows:
# - Which hooks would execute
# - What files match patterns
# - Execution order
# - No actual commands run
```

**When to use dry-run:**
- Understanding file targeting
- Verifying configuration changes
- Debugging why hooks run/don't run
- Testing new hook definitions
- Documentation of hook behavior

## Integration Patterns

### With Just (Task Runner)

```just
# Run pre-commit hooks
pre-commit:
    peter-hook run pre-commit

# Lint all files
lint:
    peter-hook lint pre-commit

# Validate configuration
validate:
    peter-hook validate --trace-imports
```

### With CI/CD

```yaml
# GitHub Actions
- name: Validate hooks
  run: peter-hook validate

- name: Run all hooks
  run: peter-hook run pre-commit --all-files
```

### With Other Tools

```bash
# Run hooks before git commit
git add -A
peter-hook run pre-commit && git commit -m "message"

# Format then lint
peter-hook lint format && peter-hook lint lint

# Validate before pushing
peter-hook validate && git push
```

## Troubleshooting

### Hook Not Running

```bash
# Check if hook is defined
peter-hook list

# Validate configuration
peter-hook validate

# Check file targeting with dry-run
peter-hook run pre-commit --dry-run

# Run with debug output
peter-hook run pre-commit --debug
```

### Configuration Invalid

```bash
# Validate and see errors
peter-hook validate

# Check import issues
peter-hook validate --trace-imports

# Get structured diagnostics
peter-hook validate --trace-imports --json | jq .
```

### Hook Execution Failed

```bash
# Run with debug output
peter-hook run pre-commit --debug

# Run individual hook in lint mode
peter-hook lint failing-hook

# Check if command exists
which <command>

# Verify file patterns match
peter-hook run pre-commit --dry-run
```

### No hooks.toml Found

```bash
# Check if file exists
ls -la hooks.toml

# Run doctor
peter-hook doctor

# Check if you're in the right directory
pwd
```

### Command Not Found

```bash
# Check if installed
which peter-hook

# Check version
peter-hook version

# Verify PATH
echo $PATH | grep -o "[^:]*\.local/bin"
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Running Pre-Commit Hooks

```bash
# See what's configured
$ peter-hook list
Git hooks installed in this repository:
  - pre-commit
  - pre-push

# Validate configuration
$ peter-hook validate
‚úì Configuration is valid

# Run pre-commit hooks
$ peter-hook run pre-commit
Running hook: format-check... ‚úì
Running hook: clippy-check... ‚úì
Running hook: test-all... ‚úì
All hooks passed!

# Or dry-run first
$ peter-hook run pre-commit --dry-run
Would run hooks for pre-commit:
  - format-check (matches **/*.rs)
  - clippy-check (matches **/*.rs, Cargo.toml)
  - test-all (run_always = true)
```

### Example 2: Linting All Files

```bash
# Validate first
$ peter-hook validate
‚úì Configuration is valid

# Run formatter on all Rust files
$ peter-hook lint rust-format
Running hook: rust-format
  Processing 45 files...
  Formatted 3 files
‚úì Hook passed

# Run entire pre-commit suite on all files
$ peter-hook lint pre-commit
Running hook: format-check... ‚úì
Running hook: clippy-check... ‚úì
Running hook: test-all... ‚úì
All hooks passed!
```

### Example 3: Troubleshooting Hook Issues

```bash
# Check health
$ peter-hook doctor
üè• peter-hook health check
==========================
Git Repository: ‚úÖ
Configuration: ‚úÖ
Updates: ‚úÖ

# Validate with diagnostics
$ peter-hook validate --trace-imports
‚úì Configuration is valid
  Imports: ../hooks.lib.toml
  Overrides: rust-lint (local overrides imported)
  No cycles detected

# Test with dry-run
$ peter-hook run pre-commit --dry-run
Would run hooks for pre-commit:
  - format-check
  - clippy-check

# Run with debug
$ peter-hook run pre-commit --debug
[DEBUG] Resolved config: /repo/hooks.toml
[DEBUG] Changed files: src/lib.rs, Cargo.toml
[DEBUG] Hook 'format-check' matches files
...
```

### Example 4: Working with File Targeting

```bash
# See what would run for current changes
$ git status --short
M  src/lib.rs
M  README.md

$ peter-hook run pre-commit --dry-run
Would run hooks for pre-commit:
  - rust-format (matches src/lib.rs)
  - rust-lint (matches src/lib.rs)
  - rust-test (matches src/lib.rs)
  - security-scan (run_always = true)

# Note: No docs hooks run because only .rs files changed
# security-scan always runs regardless

# Force all hooks
$ peter-hook run pre-commit --all-files
# Runs ALL hooks regardless of changed files
```

## Notes

- Peter Hook version 3.2.1 as of October 2025
- Configuration file: `hooks.toml` in repository
- Hierarchical resolution: each file finds nearest config
- File targeting: hooks only run if patterns match (unless `run_always = true`)
- Parallel execution: read-only hooks run in parallel, modifying hooks run sequentially
- Template variables use `{VAR}` syntax (not `${VAR}` - changed in v3.0.0)
- Lint mode treats current directory as root
- JSON output available for validation diagnostics

## Best Practices

### Running Hooks

1. **Validate before running**: `peter-hook validate` catches config errors
2. **Use dry-run**: Test with `--dry-run` to understand execution
3. **Debug when needed**: Add `--debug` for troubleshooting
4. **Run manually before commit**: Catch issues early with `peter-hook run pre-commit`

### Linting

1. **Lint before CI**: Run `peter-hook lint` on all files before pushing
2. **Target specific paths**: `cd` to subdirectory and lint from there
3. **Test hooks individually**: `peter-hook lint hook-name` for focused checks
4. **Use dry-run**: See what files would be checked before executing

### Configuration Validation

1. **Validate after changes**: Always run `peter-hook validate` after editing hooks.toml
2. **Check imports**: Use `--trace-imports` to understand merge order
3. **Use JSON output**: Parse structured diagnostics with `jq` in scripts
4. **Test with dry-run**: Verify hooks run as expected before committing config

### Troubleshooting

1. **Start with doctor**: Run `peter-hook doctor` for health check
2. **Validate config**: Run `peter-hook validate` to catch errors
3. **Use debug mode**: Add `--debug` to see detailed execution
4. **Test individually**: Run hooks one at a time to isolate issues
5. **Check file targeting**: Use `--dry-run` to see file matching logic
